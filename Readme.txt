Case Study:
Runbook
Clone the repo and follow these steps:
1. Go to the Project Directory: $ cd BCG_Case_Study_CarCrash 
2. On terminal, run This will build the project to run
via spark-submit. In this process a new folder with name
"dist" is created, and the code artefacts are copied into it.
3. $ cd Dist && spark-submit --master "local[*]" --py-files src.zip --files
 config.yaml main.py && cd ..
 
Dataset:
Data.zip folder has 6 csv files. Please use the data dictionary to understand the dataset (given along with this assignment) and then develop your approach to perform below analytics.
Analytics:
Application should perform below analysis and store the results for each analysis.
• Analysis 1: Find the number of crashes (accidents) in which number of persons killed are male?
• Analysis 2: How many two-wheelers are booked for crashes?
• Analysis 3: Which state has the highest number of accidents
in which females are involved?
• Analysis 4: Which are the Top 5th to 15th VEH_MAKE_IDs that
contribute to a largest number of injuries including death
• Analysis 5: For all the body styles involved in crashes,
mention the top ethnic user group of each unique body style
• Analysis 6: Among the crashed cars, what are the Top 5 Zip
Codes with the highest number crashes with alcohols as the
contributing factor to a crash (Use Driver Zip Code)
• Analysis 7: Count of Distinct Crash IDs where No Damaged
Property was observed and Damage Level
(VEH_DMAG_SCL~) is above 4 and car avails Insurance
• Analysis 8: Determine the Top 5 Vehicle Makes where drivers
are charged with speeding related offences, has licensed Drivers, uses top 10 used vehicle colours and has car licensed with the Top 25 states with highest number of offences (to be deduced from the data)
Expected Output:
1. Develop an application which is modular & follows software engineering best practices (e.g. Classes, docstrings, functions, config driven, command line executable through spark-submit)
2. Code should be properly organized in folders as a project.
3. Input data sources and output should be config driven
4. Code should be strictly developed using Dataframe APIs (Do
not use Spark SQL)
5. Share the entire project as zip or link to project in GitHub
repo.
